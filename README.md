## How to disable telemetry reporting?

Extensions published by Red Hat collect usage data and send it to Red Hat servers to help improve our products and services. Read our privacy statement and telemetry documentation to learn more.

If you don't wish to send usage data to Red Hat, you can set the `redhat.telemetry.enabled` user setting to false.

From File > Preferences > Settings (macOS: Code > Preferences > Settings), search for telemetry, and uncheck the `Redhat > Telemetry : Enabled` setting. This will silence all telemetry events from Red Hat extensions going forward.
